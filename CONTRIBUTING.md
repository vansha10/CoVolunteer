# Contributing Guidelines
* Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/vansha10/CoVolunteer/issues) here on GitHub to file bugs or feature requests.
* Before starting to work on an issue, ask to be assigned to that issue. Make sure that it is not already assigned to some one else.
* When working on issues make sure that you are working on your own fork of the repository.
* Create a new branch for every issue with issue name or number as branch name.
* Before making a pull request, run `git pull origin <branch_name>` to pull changes from repository.
* Make sure to [squash your commits](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5189560/squash-my-last-x-commits-together-using-git) into a single commit
* Ensure good code style and practices.
